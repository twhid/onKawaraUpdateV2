# onKawaraUpdate (V2)

A net artwork by [MTAA (Michael Sarff and Tim Whidden)](http://mtaa.net)

This code was hacked together in a couple of days while sitting on the floor of a hot, AC-less (but WiFi-enabled) art gallery in Dubrovnik, Croatia where MTAA was participating in [an exhibition](http://rhizome.org/community/39809/) as part of the iCommons Summit 2007. Thanks to [Nathaniel Stern](http://nathanielstern.com/) for the invite!

* Version 1 of this project was created as a [Rhizome Splash Page](http://archive.rhizome.org/exhibition/splashback/24_mtaa.php) and largely written by [Alex Galloway](http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/). 
* The source for this project has [long been available](http://www.mteww.com/update/onkawara/oku_source.zip) under a the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html). Go to [onKawaraUpdate (v2)](http://www.mteww.com/update/onkawara/), click the date, then click about.
* Much of the time, I shared that gallery floor with Jimmy Wales, who, I assume, was also glomming the Wifi (guess Wifi was hard to come by in Dubrovnik in 2007).
* Uses an unminified [1.1.2](http://blog.jquery.com/2007/02/27/jquery-112/) version of jQuery! It was the latest version at the time.
